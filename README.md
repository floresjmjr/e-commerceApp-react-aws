# E-Commerce App

## Background
An e-commerce web page that has an interactive navigation menu, multiple categories and subcategories, slides, shopping cart and checkout forms while partially using an amazon data set that was parsed to add a variety of products.

The dataset that was used came from http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/links.html.  Made it convient to not have to generate so much fake seed data and have access to hyperlinks that connect to pictures.

## Technologies Used
### Front-End
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* *I'm currently learning redux and will make changes to this app incorporating redux.

### Back-end
* No backend currently but will be using AWS Lambda functions (FaaS) soon to process the payment as the app gets developed further so the app can have a serverless architecture.

### Database
* Firebase  (I plan on learning DynamoDB and will switch when I do)

### Deployment
* Firebase  (This will also change once I starting using AWS Lambda functions and other AWS microservices)
